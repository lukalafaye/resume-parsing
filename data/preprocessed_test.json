The IPv6 address space reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) processing by border routers at network edges. \u2022 Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6 addresses to individual router interfaces. The forwarding of IPv6 traffic can be enabled globally, and Cisco Express Forwarding switching for IPv6 can also be enabled \u2022 The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the demand for globally unique IP addresses. \u2022 Mainly involves to checks the functionality of all waas features to work with v6 addressing  PRODUCT IPv6 Support on WAAS (Wide Area Application Services)  PROJECT CISCO-WAAS Express (WEXP)  Member Technical Staff - Automation & Testing  Cisco Systems -  January 2013 to December 2013  DURATION Jan-2013 to December-2013 TEAM SIZE 21 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES Member Technical Staff - Automation & Testing \u2022 Identified the automatable cases from the test plan. \u2022 Prepared the HLD document for the automatable cases. \u2022 Automated test cases for various components on the wexp product for the functionality check. \u2022 Worked on Config_Sync, HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, SMB_AO component automation. \u2022 Automated around 200+ cases for various components. \u2022 Performed regression for all the automated cases through ATS framework with aetest script template. \u2022 Reviewed the automated cases developed by team members. \u2022 Involved in executing all the automated cases for various releases as Phase1, Phase2 (pi19-25) and posted results in TIMS tool. \u2022 Regression Testing \u2022 Defect filing in CDETS  LANGUAGE TCL Programming, Python RELEASES Phase1 &Phase2 (with 535) DESCRIPTION \u2022 Cisco's Wide-Area Application Services (WAAS) Express feature is a key component of the Cisco WAAS product portfolio.

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based applications on a given network. \u2022 WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt    to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server. \u2022 The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized \u2022 Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform check.
