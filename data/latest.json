Due to the growth of Information Technology (IT) and telecommunications sectors in the recent past, the dissemination of alert messages has become prompt and easier. Since the existing business environment faces the challenge of reaching increasingly segmented markets, the design, delivery, and analysis of business communications needs to be tightly    integrated across multiple alert notification channels. Telecommunication channels through which subscribers can receive alert messages may include email, fax, text messaging, instant messaging, broadband network and the like. Due to myriad software applications implemented by businesses and the vast demographics of customers, it may become necessary to segment alert messages so that the messages can be sent through channels based on business needs as well as customer preferences. Further, in order to maintain strong customer relationships, businesses need to time the messages precisely. This brief illustrates how Alert Notification System (IANS) can help organization leverage existing infrastructure to better service their customers.

After the successful completion of that we incorporated flex in to the account section also. This data which is obtained from DataBase is taken by the flex using a remote procedure call and the data is shown to the user. With the use of Advanced Data Grids, Charts(including Bar and Pie Charts) the site increased the readability and understandability of the users who were previously using the pages on java server pages. This site developed by us won the IMC (Interactive Media Council)'s outstanding achievement award in Financial information.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

Together we call as CSPC or Common Services Platform Collector.CSPC-NOS is an add-on service which is written on top of the CSPC i.e., extra software written by the Nos team based on the CSPC 2.0 base code to cater to a group of customers. CSPC-NOS support on both Windows and Linux Cent OS platform. The Windows CSPC-NOS client can connect to the CSPC-NOS Linux server and vice- versa. Devices can be added manually or using the import seed file. When importing a seed file\/ When Device discovery is triggered the Device discovery module collects light inventory data from the devices. The light inventory data contain information like Sys Object Id, device family, OS-version etc. . (This information collected can be seen by going to Reports->Managed Devices) This light inventory data is used by the inventory module to load the model rule for the respective device. This data is also used by the base collector to decide whether the device is managed or unmanaged.

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based applications on a given network. • WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt    to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server. • The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized • Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform check.
